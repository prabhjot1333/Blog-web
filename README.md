# Blog-web
So this is a project I was making after learning Node.js, Express.js and Ejs


So i have some issues with code as at this point haven't learnt about any external data storage use, and this is my basic understanding of the NPM module.

Where i am getting stuck is when i add my own blog, i am not able to see its heading and text when i want to read the blog it self. Currently only able to make the card with my own submitted card name.

Any help would be great.ðŸ˜Š
